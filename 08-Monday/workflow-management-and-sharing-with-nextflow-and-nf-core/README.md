# Workflow management and sharing with Nextflow and nf-core
Managing bioinformatics workflows (e.g. sequencing analysis pipeline) is a central problem for many of us. Simple bash scripts are maybe easy to write, but hard to run and maintain. Snakemake is a good solution for reproducibility and automation, but it is hard to reuse its components. Nextflow is a workflow manager tool like Snakemake, but solves those problems too that make Snakemake sometimes difficult to run. The price to pay is that getting into Nextflow might be hard. Here, we would like to reduce the initial time investment and help you understand the main concepts while you try building a small pipeline.
