# Functional Meta-Omics: Bioinformatics in Action
This hands-on workshop introduces participants to the bioinformatics of functional meta-omics, combining metagenomics and metaproteomics to explore microbial communities from genes to functions.  We will begin with Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing data, assembling metagenomes and generating metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Participants will then apply state-of-the-art tools for taxonomic classification and functional annotation, gaining insights into community structure and metabolic potential.  A central focus will be on using High-Performance Computing (HPC) to efficiently manage and parallelize large-scale analyses. Participants will learn how to run pipelines on HPC systems, handle job submissions, and optimize resources for data-intensive tasks. Moving to the protein level, the workshop will cover metaproteomic analysis using FragPipe for protein discovery and quantification.   Functional interpretation will be expanded through MSstats for statistical visualization of protein expression and WGCNA for co-expression network analysis.  Finally, we will integrate results using R-based visualization workflows, enabling participants to produce clear, interpretable figures that highlight taxonomic profiles, functional traits, and network-level interactions.
