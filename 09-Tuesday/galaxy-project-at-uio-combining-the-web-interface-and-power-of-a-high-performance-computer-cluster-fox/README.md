# Galaxy project at UiO - combining the web interface and power of a high performance computer cluster FOX
At USIT (https://www.usit.uio.no/) we have a galaxy instance which is connected to the High Performance Computing cluster FOX (https://galaxy.educloud.no). This instance has more than 6500 tools for bioinformatics, it actually mounts the tool directory from the Galaxy project (by CVMFS). CVMFS (CernVM File System) is a service which deploys software and reference data on computing infrastructure. CernVM-FS is a read-only file system where the applications and reference data are hosted on servers outside the computing infrastructure (FOX cluster, in our case) and are mounted in the Galaxy server as any other directory.   The galaxy-on-FOX instance is connected to an HPC cluster and allows for complex and heavy calculations. It also proposes a substantial storage of 1TB for each user. The datasets in this storage are manageable directly from the Galaxy by its file manager.  Galaxy-on-FOX is free to use and provides a daily user support for all interested users. It is very convenient for courses and teamwork in groups as it allows for sharing of resources and for reproduction both of procedures and results. It can easily integrate partners from national and foreign institutions.
