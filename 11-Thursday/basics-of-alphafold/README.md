# Basics of AlphaFold
In this workshop you will learn how to use AlphaFold3 to predict the structure of proteins. The workshop provides examples of protein-protein complexes, proteins with PTMs, protein-DNA complexes and proteins in complex with simple ligands. You will learn how to interpret AlphaFold results in terms of confidence. If you have a Fox account, you will also learn how to use the AlphaFold2 package installed on the Fox server. We will also briefly explain how to access and use the software for processing experimental cryoEM data using the Fox server.
