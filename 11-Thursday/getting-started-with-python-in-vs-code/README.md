# Getting started with Python in VS Code
This workshop is intended to get people started with Python development using VS Code, a lightweight extensible integrated development environment (IDE). It is not really intended to teach you Python - Python code will be used for demonstrations, as well as Jupyter notebooks, but the aim is to get you to the point where you can either follow Python tutorials easily, inspect and modify other people's Python code, or even start your own project! To this end, we will cover some useful aspects of VS Code such as integration with git, conda environments, and remote development.
