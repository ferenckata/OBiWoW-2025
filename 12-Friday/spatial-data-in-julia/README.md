# Spatial Data In Julia!
Spatial biology is rapidly evolving, no one is really sure what the best approach or standard analysis will look like. With a fun and fast programming language like Julia, you can test out new solutions and approaches quickly in a reactive and reproducible notebook environment. Images are just big matrices, cell data just a big data frame. Why not wrangle them with a nicely designed language that makes vectorizing functions as easy as ".", and arrays are as easy as [1,2,3]?
