# Improving software quality in bioinformatics through testing
What is testing? What types of tests are we usually performing and what types are we not? We argue that bioinformaticians, especially tool developers, should integrate unit tests and automated tests into their development practices. In this workshop we show and practice how to write unit tests and make your code testable. Code testing is fundamental to achieve good quality software. Adding automated tests to a software base have several advantages. It increases confidence that the software performs as intended. Test coverage reduces the time required for ongoing development (eg. updating or adapting a tool or a pipeline) by ensuring that the new changes are not affecting the existing functionality in unexpected ways. Writing tests enforces thinking about cases where the code might fail, thus improving the usability of the software. This process also helps improve the modularization of the code, because complex, convoluted code is much harder to test. However, thinking about tests for the first time, especially thinking about good tests for testing scientific software is not easy. Through this workshop we aim to help you get started with unit testing. If time allows, we also spend some time on how to automate tests via GitHub actions.
